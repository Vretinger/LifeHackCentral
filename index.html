                <h3>Frozen herbs</h3>

                <p>Freeze herbs in olive oil. If you have fresh herbs that you can‚Äôt use up in time, chop them up, place them in an ice cube tray, and pour olive oil over them. Freeze the tray, and whenever you need herbs for cooking, you can pop out a cube and add it directly to your pan. It‚Äôs a great way to preserve the herbs and add flavor to your dishes! üåøüç≥</p>
