                <h3>Frozen herbs</h3>

                <img src="Images/KitchenHacks/FrozenHerbs.jpg" alt="A picture showing herbs in ice trace frozen in oil" class="article-img">
                <p>Freeze herbs in olive oil. If you have fresh herbs that you can‚Äôt use up in time, chop them up, place them in an ice cube tray, and pour olive oil over them. Freeze the tray, and whenever you need herbs for cooking, you can pop out a cube and add it directly to your pan. It‚Äôs a great way to preserve the herbs and add flavor to your dishes! üåøüç≥</p>

                <h3>Ginger peeling</h3>

                <img src="Images/KitchenHacks/GingerPeeling.jpg" alt="A picture showing how to peel ginger with a spoon" class="article-img">
                <p>Peel ginger with a spoon. Instead of using a knife, which can remove too much of the ginger, use the edge of a spoon to scrape off the skin. It‚Äôs much easier and you‚Äôll waste less of the ginger. Plus, it‚Äôs safer for your fingers! ü•Ñ‚ú®+</p>

                <h3>Vegetable broth</h3><div class="hack-content">
                <img src="Images/KitchenHacks/VegtableBroth.jpg" alt="A picture showing a freezerbag filled with vegetable" class="article-img">
                <p>When making soup or stew, instead of throwing away vegetable scraps like carrot tops, onion skins, and celery ends, save them in a freezer bag. Once the bag is full, use the scraps to make homemade vegetable broth. It's a great way to reduce food waste and add extra flavor to your dishes without spending extra money on store-bought broth.

                <h3>Citrus flavor cubes</h3><div class="hack-content">
                <img src="Images/KitchenHacks/FrozenZest.jpg" alt="A picture showing citrus fruits in ice trace frozen" class="article-img">
                <p>Use Citrus Zest: Before juicing a lemon, lime, or orange, grate the zest (the outer colored part of the peel) first. Freeze the zest in small portions in an ice cube tray. It's a quick way to add bright citrus flavor to dishes without having to zest a fresh fruit every time.</p>

                <p>Don't throw away stale bread. Cube it, toss it with olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and any other desired seasonings, then bake in the oven until golden brown. Homemade croutons are perfect for salads or soups.</p>
